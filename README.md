The daemon is the adapter that a service can use to interface with the SingularityNET platform.
In software architecture lingo, the daemon is a [sidecar proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar), â€”a process deployed next to a core application (the AI service, in this case) to abstract away some architectural concerns such
as logging and configuration as well as entire platform aspects, such as the interaction with smart
contracts or even the decision to use the Ethereum blockchain.
The two key abstraction responsibilities of the daemon are payments and request translation.
In order to authorize payments, the daemon interacts with the Multi-Party Escrow contract.
Before invoking a service through SingularityNET, a consumer must have
1. funded the Multi-Party Escrow contract (see section on payments below) and
2. opened a payment channel with the recipient as specified by the service definition
With each invocation the daemon checks that
1. the signature is authentic,
2. the payment channel has sufficient funds, and
3. the payment channel expiry is beyond a specified threshold (to ensure that the developer
can claim the accrued funds).

After these successful checks, the request is proxied to the service. The daemon also keeps track
of payment states of different clients.
